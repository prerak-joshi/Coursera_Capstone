Ignore cells with a borough that is Not assigned.\n* More than one neighborhood can exist in one postal code area. For example, in the table on the Wikipedia page, you will notice that M5A is listed twice and has two neighborhoods: Harbourfront and Regent Park. These two rows will be combined into one row with the neighborhoods separated with a comma as shown in row 11 in the above table.\n* If a cell has a borough but a Not assigned neighborhood, then the neighborhood will be the same as the borough.\n* Clean your Notebook and add Markdown cells to explain your work and any assumptions you are making.\n* In the last cell of your notebook, use the .shape method to print the number of rows of your dataframe."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# array as placeholder \nPostalCode = []\nBorough = []\nNeighbourhood = []\n\n#extract data into list from html\nrows = tables[0].find_all('tr')\n\nfor row in rows:\n    cells = row.find_all('td')\n    if len(cells) > 1:\n        PostalCode.append(cells[0].text.strip())\n        Borough.append(cells[1].text.strip())\n        Neighbourhood.append(cells[2].text.strip())", "execution_count": 5, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# construct a dataframe from arrays\ndata = np.array([PostalCode, Borough, Neighbourhood])\ncolumn =  ['PostalCode', 'Borough', 'Neighbourhood']  # The dataframe will consist of three columns: PostalCode, Borough, and Neighborhood\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data = data.T, columns = column)\ndf.info", "execution_count": 6, "outputs": [{"output_type": "execute_result", "execution_count": 6, "data": {"text/plain": "<bound method DataFrame.info of     PostalCode           Borough  \\\n0          M1A      Not assigned   \n1          M2A      Not assigned   \n2          M3A        North York   \n3          M4A        North York   \n4          M5A  Downtown Toronto   \n..         ...               ...   \n175        M5Z      Not assigned   \n176        M6Z      Not assigned   \n177        M7Z      Not assigned   \n178        M8Z         Etobicoke   \n179        M9Z      Not assigned   \n\n                                         Neighbourhood  \n0                                         Not assigned  \n1                                         Not assigned  \n2                                            Parkwoods  \n3                                     Victoria Village  \n4                            Regent Park, Harbourfront  \n..                                                 ...  \n175                                       Not assigned  \n176                                       Not assigned  \n177                                       Not assigned  \n178  Mimico NW, The Queensway West, South of Bloor,...  \n179                                       Not assigned  \n\n[180 rows x 3 columns]>"}, "metadata": {}}]}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "# Only process the cells that have an assigned borough.
